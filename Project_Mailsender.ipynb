    "# Introduction to Sending Emails with Python with code\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sending emails programmatically can be a powerful tool for automating communication in various applications, such as sending notifications, reports, or updates to users. Python provides several libraries that make it easy to send emails from your code. One popular library for this purpose is smtplib, which allows you to send emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "* To begin sending emails with Python, you'll need to have an SMTP server to relay your emails. You can either use a public SMTP server provided by your email service provider (such as Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo), or you can set up your own SMTP server.\n",
